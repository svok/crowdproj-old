# CrowdProj Frontend Application

This is a frontend application for the CrowdProj framework. This application is intended to be used in a non-public part of a portal. Also this application is to be compile together with cordova. So this angular application may serve not only as a web-application but also as a local application, say, in an Android device.

This application in fact is just an example. So, it bears no useful functionality right no.

## Deployment

To deploy this application just type gradle build on root of the crowdproj project.
